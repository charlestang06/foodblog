{"rating":"Rating 6/10, the salted fish made the dish very fishy and salty, which could have been toned down from soaking for a longer period of time. It was still pretty good overal, and I could’ve added more vegetables to balance out the taste.","image":"bacalhau.jpg","time":"2 hours","size":"3 servings","country":"Portugal","category":"Europe","salty":"✓","date":"July 25-August 19, 2023","flag":"🇵🇹","equipment":"butcher’s paper (I used aluminum foil)","author":"Leda Meradith | The Spruce Eats","source":"https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-to-make-salt-cod-1327910","title":"Bacalhau","numeric_rating":"6","htmlfile":"bacalhau.html","description":"My tenth recipe! Bacalhau (or Bacalao in Spanish), is salted fish, which is used in a variety of cooking from stews to fried fish and Croquetas. Just salting fish filets makes Bacalhau Fresco, which is cured and salted for 1-2 weeks. I then cooked rice with the salted fish which makes Arroz de Bacalhau. This is my first time working with fish as well!"}
,{"rating":"Rating 4/10, it was alright, but a too peanut buttery (I used to be allergic to nuts) and I didn’t really like the spice combination. The sweet potato doesn’t go too well with the stew either.","image":"domoda.jpg","time":"1.5 hours","size":"6 servings","country":"Gambia","category":"Africa","vegan":"✓","date":"June 6, 2023","flag":"🇬🇲","equipment":"Dutch oven (or a large pot)","author":"Nisha | RainbowPlantLife","source":"https://rainbowplantlife.com/vegan-west-african-peanut-stew/","title":"Domoda","numeric_rating":"4","htmlfile":"domoda.html","description":"My second recipe!

,{"rating":"Rating 6/10, the plantains were amazing and the pork was very flavorful but pretty dry. I think I either overcooked it a bit or I should use a fattier pork next time. The Epis seasoning was great, and I definitely will use it again in future dishes.","image":"griot.jpg","umami":"✓","time":"3 hours","size":"4 servings","country":"Haiti","category":"North America","salty":"✓","date":"July 27-28, 2023","flag":"🇭🇹","equipment":"deep fryer (or a large pot)","author":"The Foreign Fork","source":"https://foreignfork.com/haitian-griot-recipe/","title":"Griot","numeric_rating":"6","htmlfile":"griot.html","description":"My twelth recipe!

,{"rating":"Rating 9/10, I have made this dish before and it is definitely one of my meal prep favorties. Fun fact, I completely forgot Japanese Curry was the national dish when I made this recipe so this was created retroactively.

,{"rating":"Rating 8/10, I love the umami and sour taste combined as well as the light spice from the gochugaru. I also really liked the fried rice, which came out very well without any external seasoning.","image":"kimchi8.jpg","umami":"✓","time":"3 hours","size":"4 servings","country":"Korea","category":"Asia","salty":"✓","date":"July 5-11, 2023","flag":"🇰🇷","author":"Emily Han | the kitchn","source":"https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-easy-kimchi-at-home-189390","title":"Kimchi (and Fried Rice)","spicy":"✓","numeric_rating":"8","htmlfile":"kimchi.html","description":"My seventh recipe! I have never made fermented foods (pickles, kimchi, etc) before and this was definitely a first. This recipe used many Asian ingredients, which are sometimes a pain in the rear end to obtain (such as gochugaru spice). The outcome came out pretty well, although I think I can balance out the cabbage and radish portions better if I made it again (which I definitely will!)."}
,{"rating":"Rating 10/10, a hearty, very easy-to-use ingredients, and delicious meal! One of the best middle-eastern dishes I have eaten so far. In fact, this dish can be easily cooked from left over ingredients, and proportions are flexible to anyone’s preference. Make sure you have many pots/pans/bowls to cook this, as there are a lot of different parts!","image":"koshary.jpg","umami":"✓","time":"2.5 hours","size":"8 servings","country":"Egypt","category":"Africa","vegan":"✓","salty":"✓","date":"July 17, 2023","flag":"🇪🇬","author":"David’s Mom","title":"Koshary","numeric_rating":"10","htmlfile":"koshary.html","description":"My ninth recipe!

There are six main parts to this recipes which are rice, lentils, pasta, tomato Sauce, fried onions, and chick peas."}
,{"rating":"Rating 9/10. Since I like dumplings in general, this will be a hard dish to beat.

,{"rating":"Rating 8/10, I made it with my Spanish friend and the paella turned out really great and the rice was very tender and had the socarrat at the bottom. The flavor was seafood-ey but not too much, and the chicken was very tender. The lemon slices also balanced the flavor well. I should’ve added more saffron to balance the color or food dye. Furthermore, using fresh seafood probably would’ve made it better.","image":"paella.jpg","umami":"✓","time":"3 hours","size":"8 servings","country":"Spain","category":"Europe","salty":"✓","date":"September 4, 2023","favorite":"✓","flag":"🇪🇸","equipment":"Paelle pan (or a large pan/wok/skillet)","author":"Lauren Allen","source":"https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/paella/","title":"Paella","numeric_rating":"8","htmlfile":"paella.html","description":"My fourteenth recipe!

Shoutout to Ms. Small for the saffron!!"}
,{"rating":"Rating 9/10, a pretty light and amazing dish, the spices were not too overwhelming and the pumpkin and sesame seeds add a lot of flavor. The chicken was also very tender and juicy, and the sauce was very rich and creamy. I would definitely make this again, but I would probably add more chicken and less broth to make the sauce thicker.","image":"pepiandepollo.jpg","time":"1.5 hours","size":"3 servings","country":"Guatemala","category":"North America","salty":"✓","date":"July 16, 2023","favorite":"✓","flag":"🇬🇹","equipment":"food processor","author":"The Foreign Fork","source":"https://foreignfork.com/pepian-de-pollo/","title":"Pepian de Pollo","numeric_rating":"9","htmlfile":"pepiandepollo.html","description":"My eigth recipe!

,{"rating":"Rating 8/10, it was just as I liked it to be. The gravy was delicious (although it could have been better if I actually used real beef stock), and the cheese curds were squeaky and fresh. The fries were nice and salty, and the gravy was hot but not as flavorful as I hoped for. I would definitely make this again, and would probably deep fry my own fries for the next time or try Five Guys fries.","image":"poutine.jpg","umami":"✓","time":"1 hour","size":"4 servings","country":"Canada","category":"North America","salty":"✓","date":"July 26, 2023","flag":"🇨🇦","author":"Ms. Julie","title":"Poutine","numeric_rating":"8","htmlfile":"poutine.html","description":"My eleventh recipe!

,{"rating":"Rating 10/10. I have always loved this dish as a child, and would love to share this dish with others. It can also be served with red bean paste or salty duck egg yolk, but I prefer the meat version. However, it is by far the most complicated recipe (especially the wrapping part). Family friends and locals say my grandma makes some of the best Zongzi they have ever had, and I hope to master this recipe some day.","image":"zongzi.jpg","umami":"✓","time":"5 hours","size":"30 servings (1/serving)","country":"China","category":"Asia","salty":"✓","date":"July 1/2, 2023","favorite":"✓","flag":"🇨🇳","author":"Grandmother","title":"Zongzi","numeric_rating":"10","htmlfile":"zongzi.html","description":"My sixth recipe!

Zongzi is essentially a stick rice dumpling, which is a tradition to eat during the Dragonboat (Duanwu) Festival. It is a pretty complicated recipe, but I hope you enjoy it!"}
