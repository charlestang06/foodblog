{"rating":"Rating 4/10, it was alright, but a too peanut buttery (I used to be allergic to nuts) and I didn’t really like the spice combination. The sweet potato doesn’t go too well with the stew either.","image":"domoda.jpg","time":"1.5 hours","size":"6 servings","country":"Gambia","category":"Africa","vegan":"✓","date":"June 6, 2023","flag":"🇬🇲","author":"Nisha | RainbowPlantLife","source":"https://rainbowplantlife.com/vegan-west-african-peanut-stew/","title":"Domoda","numeric_rating":"4","htmlfile":"domoda.html","description":"My second recipe! Domoda is a Gambian Peanut Stew made with peanut butter, tomatoes, and onions, and is usually served with rice. This was my first time cooking an African dish, and also the first time making a stew using a Dutch oven."}
,{"rating":"Rating 8/10, I love the umami and sour taste combined as well as the light spice from the gochugaru. I also really liked the fried rice, which came out very well without any external seasoning.","image":"kimchi8.jpg","umami":"✓","time":"3 hours","size":"4 servings","country":"Korea","category":"Asia","salty":"✓","date":"July 5-11, 2023","flag":"🇰🇷","author":"Emily Han | the kitchn","source":"https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-easy-kimchi-at-home-189390","title":"Kimchi (and Fried Rice)","spicy":"✓","numeric_rating":"8","htmlfile":"kimchi.html","description":"My seventh recipe! I have never made fermented foods (pickles, kimchi, etc) before and this was definitely a first. This recipe used many Asian ingredients, which are sometimes a pain in the rear end to obtain (such as gochugaru spice). The outcome came out pretty well, although I think I can balance out the cabbage and radish portions better if I made it again (which I definitely will!)."}
,{"rating":"Rating 10/10, a hearty, very easy-to-use ingredients, and delicious meal! One of the best middle-eastern dishes I have eaten so far. In fact, this dish can be easily cooked from left over ingredients, and proportions are flexible to anyone’s preference. Make sure you have many pots/pans/bowls to cook this, as there are a lot of different parts!","image":"koshary.jpg","umami":"✓","time":"2.5 hours","size":"8 servings","country":"Egypt","category":"Africa","vegan":"✓","salty":"✓","date":"July 17, 2023","flag":"🇪🇬","author":"David’s Mom","title":"Koshary","numeric_rating":"10","htmlfile":"koshary.html","description":"My ninth recipe! Koshary (or Koshari) is a delicious mix of grains and sauce, with diverse flavor! It is eaten as a “peasant dish” in Egypt as the ingredients used can be found in any common household. It is also a very popular street food in Egypt, and is usually served with a red tomato sauce and fried/caramelized onions. There are six main parts to this recipes which are rice, lentils, pasta, tomato Sauce, fried onions, and chick peas."}
,{"rating":"Rating 9/10. Since I like dumplings in general, this will be a hard dish to beat. Maybe pan-fried momo would be even better.","image":"momo.jpg","umami":"✓","time":"1.5 hours","size":"10 servings (~100 momo)","country":"Nepal","category":"Asia","salty":"✓","date":"June 26, 2023","favorite":"✓","flag":"🇳🇵","author":"Friend","title":"Momo","spicy":"✓","numeric_rating":"9","htmlfile":"momo.html","description":"My fifth recipe! Since I have a Nepali friend, they showed me how to make one of the most popular dishes in Nepal, momo! Essentially, momo are dumplings, commonly served with a spicy tomato sauce. We made 175 momo, but this recipe below is scaled down for 100. It’s also a popular street food in Nepal, and can be served for any event!"}
,{"rating":"Rating 8/10. It was really spicy (maybe it a bit too spicy?) but the flavor was really great and is one of my favorite national dishes so far.","image":"nihari.jpg","time":"1 hours","size":"4 servings","country":"Pakistan","category":"Asia","date":"June 14, 2023","flag":"🇵🇰","author":"Adapted from Jamil and Ami","source":"https://jamilghar.com/nihari/","savory":"✓","title":"Nihari","spicy":"✓","numeric_rating":"8","htmlfile":"nihari.html","description":"My third recipe! Nihari is a Pakistani beef stew made with a lot of spices and seasoning, as well as beef shank. I decided to use an Instant Pot version of this recipe to make it cook faster, cut down on the portioning, and made some substitutions along the way."}
,{"rating":"Rating 9/10, a pretty light and amazing dish, the spices were not too overwhelming and the pumpkin and sesame seeds add a lot of flavor. The chicken was also very tender and juicy, and the sauce was very rich and creamy. I would definitely make this again, but I would probably add more chicken and less broth to make the sauce thicker.","image":"pepiandepollo.jpg","time":"1.5 hours","size":"3 servings","country":"Guatemala","category":"North America","salty":"✓","date":"July 16, 2023","flag":"🇬🇹","author":"The Foreign Fork","source":"https://foreignfork.com/pepian-de-pollo/","title":"Pepian de Pollo","spicy":"✓","numeric_rating":"9","htmlfile":"pepiandepollo.html","description":"My eigth recipe! This is the first North American (and Latin American) dish I made so far. It was a very interesting dish to make, as it used many ingredients that I have never used before (such as pepitas and sesame seeds). The sauce smelled so delicious throughout the process, especially with the blend of toasted seeds. This is also the first time I used a food processor, which I dug up from the basement of my house."}
,{"rating":"Rating 6/10, not bad but not great, not a huge fan of hash-brown type of foods.","image":"potatorosti.jpeg","time":"1 hour","size":"4-6 servings","country":"Switzerland","category":"Europe","vegan":"✓","date":"May 30, 2023","flag":"🇨🇭","author":"Nagi | RecipeTinEats","source":"https://www.recipetineats.com/potato-rosti/","title":"Potato Rosti","numeric_rating":"6","htmlfile":"potatorosti.html","description":"My first recipe!

,{"rating":"Rating 7/10. It was a very heavy dish, and had pretty good flavor. I would definitely make this again but with a different vegetable.","image":"stamppot.jpg","time":"1 hour","size":"4-6 servings","country":"Netherlands","category":"Europe","date":"June 17, 2023","flag":"🇳🇱","author":"Gypsyplate","source":"https://gypsyplate.com/stamppot/","savory":"✓","title":"Stamppot","numeric_rating":"7","htmlfile":"stamppot.html","description":"My fourth recipe! Stamppot is a Dutch dish that is essentially mashed potatoes with vegetables. I decided to used kale as my vegetable and served it with kielbasa sausage. It was a very simple yet hearty dish, and I really enjoyed it! I especially liked the creaminess of the mashed potatoes and how it goes with the sausage."}
,{"rating":"Rating 10/10. I have always loved this dish as a child, and would love to share this dish with others. It can also be served with red bean paste or salty duck egg yolk, but I prefer the meat version. However, it is by far the most complicated recipe (especially the wrapping part). Family friends and locals say my grandma makes some of the best Zongzi they have ever had, and I hope to master this recipe some day.","image":"zongzi.jpg","umami":"✓","time":"5 hours","size":"30 servings (1/serving)","country":"China","category":"Asia","salty":"✓","date":"July 1/2, 2023","favorite":"✓","flag":"🇨🇳","author":"Grandmother","title":"Zongzi","numeric_rating":"10","htmlfile":"zongzi.html","description":"My sixth recipe! One of my childhood favorites, I went to my grandmother’s to learn her famous recipe (Meat Zongzi). Since China’s actual national dish (Peking Duck) is near impossible to make at home, I decided to learn one of my grandmother’s recipes. Zongzi is essentially a stick rice dumpling, which is a tradition to eat during the Dragonboat (Duanwu) Festival. It is a pretty complicated recipe, but I hope you enjoy it!"}
