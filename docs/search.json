It is a thick stew made with peanut butter, tomatoes, and onions, and is usually served with rice. This was my first time cooking an African dish, and also the first time making a stew using a Dutch oven. Rating X/10, very good, but a too peanut buttery (I used to be allergic to nuts) for my taste."}
