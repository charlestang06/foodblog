{"rating":"Rating 4/10, it was alright, but a too peanut buttery (I used to be allergic to nuts) and I didn’t really like the spice combination. The sweet potato doesn’t go too well with the stew either.","image":"domoda.jpg","time":"1.5 hours","size":"6 servings","country":"Gambia","category":"Africa","vegan":"✓","date":"June 6, 2023","flag":"🇬🇲","author":"Nisha | RainbowPlantLife","source":"https://rainbowplantlife.com/vegan-west-african-peanut-stew/","title":"Domoda","numeric_rating":"4","htmlfile":"domoda.html","description":"My second recipe! Domoda is a Gambian Peanut Stew made with peanut butter, tomatoes, and onions, and is usually served with rice. This was my first time cooking an African dish, and also the first time making a stew using a Dutch oven."}
,{"rating":"Rating 8/10, I love the umami and sour taste combined as well as the light spice from the gochugaru. I also really liked the fried rice, which came out very well without any external seasoning.","image":"kimchi8.jpg","umami":"✓","time":"3 hours","size":"4 servings","country":"Korea","category":"Asia","salty":"✓","date":"July 5-11, 2023","flag":"🇰🇷","author":"Emily Han | the kitchn","source":"https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-easy-kimchi-at-home-189390","title":"Kimchi (and Fried Rice)","spicy":"✓","numeric_rating":"8","htmlfile":"kimchi.html","description":"My seventh recipe! I have never made fermented foods (pickles, kimchi, etc) before and this was definitely a first. This recipe used many Asian ingredients, which are sometimes a pain in the rear end to obtain (such as gochugaru spice). The outcome came out pretty well, although I think I can balance out the cabbage and radish portions better if I made it again (which I definitely will!)."}
,{"rating":"Rating 9/10. Since I like dumplings in general, this will be a hard dish to beat. Maybe pan-fried momo would be even better.","image":"momo.jpg","umami":"✓","time":"1.5 hours","size":"10 servings (~100 momo)","country":"Nepal","category":"Asia","salty":"✓","date":"June 26, 2023","favorite":"✓","flag":"🇳🇵","author":"Friend","title":"Momo","spicy":"✓","numeric_rating":"9","htmlfile":"momo.html","description":"My fifth recipe! Since I have a Nepali friend, they showed me how to make one of the most popular dishes in Nepal, momo! Essentially, momo are dumplings, commonly served with a spicy tomato sauce. We made 175 momo, but this recipe below is scaled down for 100. It’s also a popular street food in Nepal, and can be served for any event!"}
,{"rating":"Rating 8/10. It was really spicy (maybe it a bit too spicy?) but the flavor was really great and is one of my favorite national dishes so far.","image":"nihari.jpg","time":"1 hours","size":"4 servings","country":"Pakistan","category":"Asia","date":"June 14, 2023","flag":"🇵🇰","author":"Adapted from Jamil and Ami","source":"https://jamilghar.com/nihari/","savory":"✓","title":"Nihari","spicy":"✓","numeric_rating":"8","htmlfile":"nihari.html","description":"My third recipe! Nihari is a Pakistani beef stew made with a lot of spices and seasoning, as well as beef shank. I decided to use an Instant Pot version of this recipe to make it cook faster, cut down on the portioning, and made some substitutions along the way."}
,{"rating":"Rating 6/10, not bad but not great, not a huge fan of hash-brown type of foods.","image":"potatorosti.jpeg","time":"1 hour","size":"4-6 servings","country":"Switzerland","category":"Europe","vegan":"✓","date":"May 30, 2023","flag":"🇨🇭","author":"Nagi | RecipeTinEats","source":"https://www.recipetineats.com/potato-rosti/","title":"Potato Rosti","numeric_rating":"6","htmlfile":"potatorosti.html","description":"My first recipe!

This was also my first time using a box grater!"}
,{"rating":"Rating 7/10. It was a very heavy dish, and had pretty good flavor. I would definitely make this again but with a different vegetable.","image":"stamppot.jpg","time":"1 hour","size":"4-6 servings","country":"Netherlands","category":"Europe","date":"June 17, 2023","flag":"🇳🇱","author":"Gypsyplate","source":"https://gypsyplate.com/stamppot/","savory":"✓","title":"Stamppot","numeric_rating":"7","htmlfile":"stamppot.html","description":"My fourth recipe! Stamppot is a Dutch dish that is essentially mashed potatoes with vegetables. I decided to used kale as my vegetable and served it with kielbasa sausage. It was a very simple yet hearty dish, and I really enjoyed it! I especially liked the creaminess of the mashed potatoes and how it goes with the sausage."}
,{"rating":"Rating 10/10. I have always loved this dish as a child, and would love to share this dish with others. It can also be served with red bean paste or salty duck egg yolk, but I prefer the meat version. However, it is by far the most complicated recipe (especially the wrapping part). Family friends and locals say my grandma makes some of the best Zongzi they have ever had, and I hope to master this recipe some day.","image":"zongzi.jpg","umami":"✓","time":"5 hours","size":"30 servings (1/serving)","country":"China","category":"Asia","salty":"✓","date":"July 1/2, 2023","favorite":"✓","flag":"🇨🇳","author":"Grandmother","title":"Zongzi","numeric_rating":"10","htmlfile":"zongzi.html","description":"My sixth recipe! One of my childhood favorites, I went to my grandmother’s to learn her famous recipe (Meat Zongzi). Since China’s actual national dish (Peking Duck) is near impossible to make at home, I decided to learn one of my grandmother’s recipes. Zongzi is essentially a stick rice dumpling, which is a tradition to eat during the Dragonboat (Duanwu) Festival. It is a pretty complicated recipe, but I hope you enjoy it!"}
