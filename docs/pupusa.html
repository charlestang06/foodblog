                 <p>My eighteenth recipe! Pupusa is a traditional El
Salvadorian dish that is a thick corn tortilla stuffed with cheese,
beans, and/or meat. I made this dish for Thanksgiving it was a great
experience! The dough was very easy to make and the filling was very
flavorful. The pupusas were very filling and were a great addition to
the Thanksgiving table.</p>
                 <p>Rating 7/10, it was good but not too flavorful. I
would’ve used some more Central American seasoning on the ground beef
and the masa harina flour to enhance the flavor. I would also use a
different cheese next time, maybe a queso fresco or a cotija cheese.</p>

        <li><h3 id="cooking">Cooking</h3></li>
        <li><code>1 lb</code> lean ground beef (season with onion/garlic
        powder, salt, pepper, and any other seasoning you wish)</li>
        <li><code>6 cups</code> masa harina</li>
        <li><code>5.5 cups</code> water</li>
        <li><code>8 tbsp</code> fine grain sea salt</li>
        <li><code>3 cups</code> shredded mozarrella cheese or mexican
        cheese blend</li>
        <li><code>1/2 cup</code> vegetable oil (for cooking)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Mix in salt and flour in a large mixing bowl with a fork. Add
        water and mix with hands until dough forms. Knead dough for 5
        minutes.</p>
        <p>Once the dough becomes like a dry playdough, cover with a
        damp towel and let rest for 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>Cook ground beef in a skillet until brown. Season with salt,
        pepper, and any other seasoning as you wish.</p>
        <p>Split the dough into around 15 2-inch balls. Make a well in
        each and fill with 1 tbsp of cheese and 1 tbsp of ground beef.
        Close the dough around the filling and flatten into a 1/4 inch
        thick disk.</p>

        <p>Heat oil in a large skillet. In batches, cook the pupusas for
        5-6 minutes on each side, or until a darker brown. Serve with
        salsa. Enjoy!</p>

        <p>Reflecting on this recipe, as I went through the cooking
        process, I gradually made the Pupusa’s flatter as I went on as
        the thicker ones weren’t well cooked inside. So, I would
        recommend making the balls as round as possible then flatten it
        as flat as possible. Then, you can patch up any weak points.
        Lastly, I think a better mexican blend or specialty cheeses
        would have enhanced the flavor and using beef birria would have
        been a great addition to the pupusa as a dip or for the
        filling.</p>
