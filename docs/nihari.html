                 <p>Cooked on June 14, 2023.</p>
                 <p>My third recipe! Nihari is a Pakistani beef stew made with a lot of spices and seasoning, as well as beef shank. I decided to use an Instant Pot version of this recipe to make it cook faster, cut down on the portioning, and made some substitutions along the way.</p>
                 <p>Rating 8/10. It was really spicy (maybe it a bit too spicy?) but the flavor was really great and is one of my favorite national dishes so far.</p>

        <li><code>1</code> large white onion</li>
        <li><code>1/2 in</code> ginger</li>
        <li><code>1 clove</code> garlic</li>
        <li><code>1 lb</code> beef shank (preferrably with bones, but I didn’t use bones and remember to DEFROST OVERNIGHT)</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Since beef shank isn’t usually sold in traditional supermarkets, i had to get it from my grandmother (since it’s usually used in Asian dishes)! I also used the Shan Nihari seasoning packet rather than a custom mix since I’m pretty bad at seasoning.</p>
        <p>Dice the white onion into very thin pieces. A food processor should be fine.</p>
        <p>Finely mince the ginger and garlic.</p>
        <p>Defrost the beef shank overnight in the fridge, then rinse and cut into 1 or 2 inch cubes. If you have bones, cut the meat off the bones and set aside the bones for later.</p>

        <li><h3 id="cooking">Cooking</h3></li>
        <li><code>1/2</code> cup ghee</li>
        <li><code>1/3</code> packet Nihari seasoning (Shan brand)</li>
        <li><code>2</code> cups water (enough to cover the meat in the pot)</li>
        <li><code>1-2 tbsp</code> corn starch</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Heat the ghee in an Instant Pot on saute mode. Add the onion and saute until caramelized and brown for about 10 minutes. Remove half the onions using a wooden spoon and set them aside. Stir the garlic and ginger into the pot to remove the “freshness” smell. You may need to splash a little water to deglaze the pot.</p>
        <p>Add the Nihari seasoning to the pot, splash water to prevent the seasoning from sticking/burning. Then, add the beef shank pieces and stir to coat the meat in the seasoning. Wait until the meat changes color from red to slgihtly brown (2-3 min). Splash water whenever the seasoning sticks to the bottom of the pot.</p>
        <p>Add the removed onions and the water (less if you splashed a lot) and stir to combine. If you have bones, add them now. Close the lid and cook on high pressure for 30 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally.</p>
        <p>Serve with Naan or rice. I served it with Naan (from the supermarket) abut I mixed microwave-melted ghee and garlic powder to make this finger-licking garlic butter. Then, I spread it on toasted Naan. Mmmmm so delicious! It was really spicy, so use 1/5 of the Shan packet if you do not want it to be that spicy.</p>

It was a relatively straightforward and easy process, but deglazing the pot was a hassle at times. It looks really delicious!</p>
