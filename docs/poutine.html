                 <p>Cooked on July 26, 2023.</p>
                 <p>My eleventh recipe! Canadian Poutine is made with
fries topped with a delicious gravy and squeeeeeeeaky cheese curds
(straight from Canada!). It is a hearty dish that is perfect for a cold
winter day, yet I cooked it in a heatwave in July. Poutine is a dish
that is very popular in Canada, and is a must-try for anyone visiting
the country.</p>
                 <p>Rating 8/10, it was just as I liked it to be. The
gravy was delicious (although it could have been better if I actually
used real beef stock), and the cheese curds were squeaky and fresh. The
fries were nice and salty, and the gravy was hot but not as flavorful as
I hoped for. I would definitely make this again, and would probably deep
fry my own fries for the next time or try Five Guys fries.</p>

        <p>In another pot, melt the butter. Mix corn starch into cold

        beef stock from the other pot and stir until it thickens.</p>

        <p>Check out these cheese curds straight from Canada, courtesy
        to Ms. Julie!! Thanks Ms. Julie!!!</p>

        <p>Update: I made this again with Five Guys fries (ordered extra
        crispy) and it was amazing! The fries were so crispy and salty,
        and the gravy was so flavorful. Ms. Julie brought an even larger
        bag of cheese curds and it would so delicious. She showed me how
        to make a roux in an Instant Pot and showed me how she made her
        gravy. I thought it was a bit too black peppery but is
        definitely a grown taste. I would also recommend using real beef
        stock instead of bouillon cubes, as it would make the gravy more
        flavorful. A quick an easy recipe for on the go!</p>
