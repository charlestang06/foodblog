                 <p>My nineteenth recipe! Lomo Saltado is a traditional
Peruvian dish that is a stir fry of beef, onions, tomatoes, and other
ingredients. I did not include the french fries that are traditionally
served with this recipe, but included a side of white rice. Did you know
that this dish is actually inspired by Chinese-Peruvian immigrants in
the late 1800s? Pretty cool, huh?</p>
                 <p>Rating 8.5/10, it was flavorful and captured the
perfect umami taste I was looking for after a long trip home from
vacation. I’m not sure about how french fries would go with this recipe,
but would definitely try again as it is a cool recipe for a high-protein
meal prep!</p>

        <ul>
        <li><h3 id="cooking">Cooking</h3></li>
        <li><code>1 lb</code> stir-fry beef slices (or sirloin steak,
        cut into 1/4-inch strips)</li>
        <li><code>1/4 cup</code> vegetable oil</li>
        <li><code>1</code> medium red onion, cut into 1/2-inch
        slices</li>
        <li><code>4</code> scallions, roots and any wilted parts
        trimmed, remainder cut into 2-inch lengths</li>
        <li><code>2</code> bell peppers (one red, one orange), stemmed,
        seeded, and cut into 1/4-inch strips</li>
        <li><code>2</code> medium plum tomatoes, cored and cut into
        3/4-inch-thick wedges</li>
        <li><code>2</code> medium cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li><code>1-inch piece</code> peeled fresh ginger (about 1/4
        ounce; 7g), minced</li>
        <li><code>1.5 tbsp</code> soy sauce</li>
        <li><code>1 tbsp</code> dark vinegar</li>
        <li><code>1 tsp</code> fish sauce</li>
        <li><code>0.5 tsp</code> freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li><code>1 bowl</code> cooked long-grain rice, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
        <p>To make a sauce mixture, mix the soy sauce, dark vinegar,
        fish sauce, and black pepper in a small bowl. Set aside.</p>
        <p><img src="lomosaltado2.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
        <p>In a wok, heat 2 tbsp of oil over high heat until smoking,
        add beef , and cook, stirring and tossing occasionally, until
        browned on all sides, about 3 minutes. Season all sides with
        salt generously. Transfer to a plate and set aside.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Work in batches if your wok is not that big. If you are not
        afraid of fire, toss over an even higher heat ot catch some
        flames! I did not do this, unfortunately.</p>
        </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>After cooking the beef, add another tablespoon to coat the
        bottom and heat until smoking. Add the red onion and toss until
        seared on all sides. Remove and set aside.</p>
        <p>Bring the wok back to high heat and add the remaining
        tablespoon of oil (smoking point again!). Add the scallions and
        bell peppers and cook, tossing occasionally, until lightly
        charred on all sides, about 3 minutes.</p>
        <p>Add the tomatoes, garlic, and ginger and cook, tossing
        occasionally, until tomatoes are lightly charred and beginning
        to break down, about 2 minutes longer. Add the soy sauce,
        vinegar, fish sauce, and black pepper and cook, tossing
        constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Return the beef
        and onions to the wok and toss to combine.</p>
        <p>Lastly, toss everything that was set aside back into the wok
        to finish off the stir fry. Stir vigorously to mix thoroughly.
        Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately with rice
        and french fries. Enjoy!</p>

        <p>I modified the recipe to add some fish sauce to get an even
        more umami taste, inspired by one of my favorite childhood
        dishes: Yu Xiang Qie Zi (鱼香茄子), which is a umami stir fry
        eggplant dish.</p>
        <p>I think the key takeaway from high heat stir frying is to
        ALWAYS bring the oil back to smoking and to cook in small
        batches, only combining everything at the end. This is the only
        way to get that wok hei (smokiness from the wok) flavor.</p>
        <p>For subsitutions, I could not find Aji amarillo peppers to
        provide the spice so I got bell peppers instead. For a spicier
        option, throw in some chiles or jalapenos. I also did not
        include the french fries that are traditionally served with this
        dish, but included a side of white rice.</p>
