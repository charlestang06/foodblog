          <p style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; margin-top:2rem; padding: 0.5rem;">Welcome to my (Charles’s) food blog, where I will cook every (or as many as I can) national dish for my Senior Independent Study Project (SISP) at Mass Academy!</p>
          <p style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; padding: 0.5rem;">
            I'm Charles, a current senior at Mass Academy, and my cooking skills
            are pretty limited. In the past, I have made breakfast eggs or basic
            fried rice dishes, but nothing fancier than home-friendly foods. In
            fact, I recently participated in Mass Academy's cooking club run by
            Ms. Small and Dr. Crowthers, which I greatly enjoyed. My SISP
            project is to spend at least 100 hours to become more skillful at
            cooking and experienced with various cultures and flavors around the
            globe. From learning different cooking tools to playing around with
            different spice combinations, I will embark on a journey across the
            world while staying in the vicinity of my kitchen.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; padding: 0.5rem;">
            Furthermore, I hope to gain food blogging and photography skills by
            creating a food blog/online cookbook website showcasing my work. I
            hope you enjoy exploring these recipes I cook! I will also be
            leaving my personal reviews on each recipe I cook, and since I have
            a very particular taste for foods, don't get too riled up by my
            ratings; I am just a high school student.

     <p>My second recipe! Domoda is a Gambian Peanut Stew made with peanut butter, tomatoes, and onions, and is usually served with rice. This was my first time cooking an African dish, and also the first time making a stew using a Dutch oven.</p>

     <p>My third recipe! Nihari is a Pakistani beef stew made with a lot of spices and seasoning, as well as beef shank. I decided to use an Instant Pot version of this recipe to make it cook faster, cut down on the portioning, and made some substitutions along the way.</p>
