                            <p>Welcome to my food blog, where I will be cooking every national dish for my Senior Independent Study Project (SISP) at Mass Academy! The intent of my SISP project is spend at least 100 hours in total in order to become more skillful at cooking and experienced with various cultures and flavors around the globe. Furthermore, I hope to gain some food blogging and photography skills by creating a food blog website showcasing my work. I hope you enjoy exploring these recipes I cook!</p>

                                                <p>Domoda, or Domodah, is a Gambian Peanut Stew that is popular in West African countries. It is a thick stew made with peanut butter, tomatoes, and onions, and is usually served with rice. This was my first time cooking an African dish, and also the first time making a stew using a Dutch oven. Rating 4/10, it was alright, but a too peanut buttery (I used to be allergic to nuts) and I didn’t really like the spice combination.</p>
