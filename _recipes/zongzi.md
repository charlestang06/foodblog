description: My sixth recipe! One of my childhood favorites, I went to my grandmother's to learn her famous recipe (Meat Zongzi). Since China's actual national dish (Peking Duck) is near impossible to make at home, I decided to learn one of my grandmother's recipes. Zongzi is essentially a stick rice dumpling, which is a tradition to eat during the Dragonboat (Duanwu) Festival. It is a pretty complicated recipe, but I hope you enjoy it!
date: July 1/2, 2023
rating: Rating 10/10. I have always loved this dish as a child, and would love to share this dish with others. It can also be served with red bean paste or salty duck egg yolk, but I prefer the meat version. However, it is by far the most complicated recipe (especially the wrapping part). Family friends and locals say my grandma makes some of the best Zongzi they have ever had, and I hope to master this recipe some day.

>
> <img src="zongzi6.jpg" width="100%" ></img> 
> 
> For each leaf or leaves, fold it hot dog style down the center and fold over the top section (1.5 in) to the right. Hold your non-dominant arm out and place the leaf along your non-dominant arm, with the top fold nestled between your index and your middle finger.

> 
> > > It is essential to keep the top fold tight, but make sure the two sides are even.
>
>  Spread some rice inside the fold at the top, then make a small indentation in the middle to place one or two pieces of pork inside it. 
>
> <img src="zongzi8.jpg" width="100%" ></img> 
> 
> Place one or two pieces of meat inside the indentation.

> 
> Then, spread some more rice to cover the meat. 
>

> Fold the bottom of the leaf over the top.

> <img src="zongzi11.jpg" width="100%" ></img> 
> 
> Next, wrap the sides down gently so that it is in the shape of a triangle. Make sure the bottom corners are pointy. Do one side at a time, using your non-dominant hand to hold the wrapped leaf in place or to block any small holes. 
>
> <img src="zongzi12.jpg" width="100%" ></img> 
> 
> > > If necessary, wrap an additional bamboo leaf around the sides (around the top edge) to secure the sides.
> 
> > > Make sure to wipe any excess rice off the sides and the top fold using a chopstick of your finger (very important)
>
> <img src="zongzi13.jpg" width="100%" ></img> 
> 
> Holding the zong zi in its triangle shape, tie the cooking string around and around the Zongzi horizontally to keep its shape while cooking.
>
> > > The most important part of this whole wrapping process is that all folds are held down by your fingers, it is extremely difficult and usually takes years of practice!

> Reflecting on this recipe, I think it will be a few years before i could ever attempt this recipe again. It was so painstakingly difficult, and even experienced chefs would take several weeks to master the folding techniques. My grandmother folds them in a special way to make them even larger than normal Zongzi, as normal Zongzi would not be as difficult to fold.

> Zongzi
> 
> after stuffing my stomachâ€™s void with five zongzi and admiring my palms smothered with sticky starchy rice filling i say, i want to make my grandmotherâ€™s famous zongzi. a ten-so mile expedition to the formosa market, returning with a bag of premium glutinous rice, twelve ounces of dried bamboo leaves imported from mainland, savory soy sauce and msg submerged pork shoulder, i am ready.

> grandmother by my side, she recites the recipe for the tenth time. 
> 
> step one: spread bamboo leaf precisely down length of forearm, scratchy, ticklish like prickly pine needles. 
> 
> step 2: fill with spoonful-lump of rice, cool and hard, place pork in the center. deep breaths.
> 
> step 3: fold flawlessly, yet my clumsy fingers betray me. rice streams out of my imperfect caving folds, spilling like bouncing beans onto the hard floor. she snatches the half-wrapped mess from my sweaty palms.
