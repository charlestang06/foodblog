description: My fifth recipe! Since I have a Nepali friend, they showed me how to make one of the most popular dishes in Nepal, momo! Essentially, momo are dumplings, commonly served with a spicy tomato sauce. We made 175 momo, but this recipe below is scaled down for 100. It's also a popular street food in Nepal, and can be served for any event!
date: June 26, 2023
rating: Rating 9/10. Since I like dumplings in general, this will be a hard dish to beat. Maybe pan-fried momo would be even better.

> Itâ€™s time to wrap the momo! For each momo, put a spoonful of just-mixed filling into a dumpling wrap, and dip the fingers into a bowl of water to close the wrap. Make sure that the table has a small coat of flour to prevent sticking. Watch the video below of how to wrap momo! Place each wrapped momo into a nonstick plate.

- ### More Content!

> Here are some more pictures throughout the process of cooking the Momo. It was fun as I hadn't wrapped dumplings in maybe 10 years. It was pretty spicy, but manageable, and was very delicious!! I would definitely make this again but maybe try pork or ground beef. I also want to try pan-frying momo or making soup-filled momo.
