description: My eleventh recipe! Canadian Poutine is made with fries topped with a delicious gravy and squeeeeeeeaky cheese curds (straight from Canada!). It is a hearty dish that is perfect for a cold winter day, yet I cooked it in a heatwave in July. Poutine is a dish that is very popular in Canada, and is a must-try for anyone visiting the country.

rating: Rating 8/10, it was just as I liked it to be. The gravy was delicious (although it could have been better if I actually used real beef stock), and the cheese curds were squeaky and fresh. The fries were nice and salty, and the gravy was hot but not as flavorful as I hoped for. I would definitely make this again, and would probably deep fry my own fries for the next time or try Five Guys fries.

> Update: I made this again with Five Guys fries (ordered extra crispy) and it was amazing! The fries were so crispy and salty, and the gravy was so flavorful. Ms. Julie brought an even larger bag of cheese curds and it would so delicious. She showed me how to make a roux in an Instant Pot and showed me how she made her gravy. I thought it was a bit too black peppery but is definitely a grown taste. I would also recommend using real beef stock instead of bouillon cubes, as it would make the gravy more flavorful. A quick an easy recipe for on the go!
