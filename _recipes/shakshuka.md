description: My sixteenth recipe! Shakshuka is a delicious tomato-based breakfast dish with eggs poached in the sauce. It is a popular dish in the Middle East and North Africa, and is usually served with bread or some other type of grain. The dish is very easy to make and is very customizable with spices and herbs to make it more flavorful.

rating: Rating 7.5/10, it was a delicous brunch dish with a good amount of vegetables. The italian sausage was a great add and provided a good kick with the very flavorful sauce. The eggs were cooked a too hard and the dish was very filling.
