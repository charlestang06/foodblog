description: My ninth recipe! Koshary (or Koshari) is a delicious mix of grains and sauce, with diverse flavor! It is eaten as a "peasant dish" in Egypt as the ingredients used can be found in any common household. It is also a very popular street food in Egypt, and is usually served with a red tomato sauce and fried/caramelized onions. There are six main parts to this recipes which are rice, lentils, pasta, tomato Sauce, fried onions, and chick peas.

rating: Rating 10/10, a hearty, very easy-to-use ingredients, and delicious meal! One of the best middle-eastern dishes I have eaten so far. In fact, this dish can be easily cooked from left over ingredients, and proportions are flexible to anyone's preference. Make sure you have many pots/pans/bowls to cook this, as there are a lot of different parts!
