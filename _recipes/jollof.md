description: My fifteenth recipe! Jollof is a very popular dish in West Africa, and is a tomato-based rice dish. It is very similar to Spanish paella, but with a lot more spices and flavor. It is a very popular dish in Nigeria, and is often served with chicken or beef.

rating: Rating 7/10, the spices were not too overwhelming (I probably didn't put enough), and the rice was very flavorful. I would definitely recommend this dish to anyone who wants to try something new and different!
