description: My fourth recipe! Stamppot is a Dutch dish that is essentially mashed potatoes with vegetables. I decided to used kale as my vegetable and served it with kielbasa sausage. It was a very simple yet hearty dish, and I really enjoyed it! I especially liked the creaminess of the mashed potatoes and how it goes with the sausage.

rating: Rating 7/10. It was a very heavy dish, and had pretty good flavor. I would definitely make this again but with a different vegetable.

> Surprisingly, this was my first time making mashed potatoes!

>
> While the potatoes are cooking, heat 2 tbsp of butter in a pan on medium heat. Add the garlic and shallots and cook for 2 minutes. Add the kale and 1/4 cup water and steam with a lid for 5 minutes, until the kale is wilted. Set aside.
>
> After draining the potato water, mash with butter, milk, salt, pepper, and ground cinnamon. Once smooth, stir in the kale mixture.
>
> In the meantime, saute the kielbasa sausage in a pan until browned.
>
> Serve with the mashed potato on the bottom and sausage laid ontop. Enjoy!
