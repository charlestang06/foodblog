description: My thirteenth recipe! Japanese Curry (or Kare) is a flavorful and well-liked dish for any occasion. I cooked it this time for my meal prep, and it was a great choice. I used a pre-made curry roux and topped it with some flavorful chicken (or no chicken for a vegan alternative). I will definitely be making this again in the future!

rating: Rating 9/10, I have made this dish before and it is definitely one of my meal prep favorties. Fun fact, I completely forgot Japanese Curry was the national dish when I made this recipe so this was created retroactively. Apologies for the lack of photos!

- ### Cooking
- `4 cubes` mild (or spicy) Golden Curry mix (1 box)
- `2.75 cups` water
- `2` medium russet potatoes (chopped into cubes/small chunks)
- `0.5` red onion (sliced thinly)
- `6` carrots (chopped into cubes/small chunks)
- `2 tsp` kosher salt
- `2 tbsp` vegetable oil
- Cooked white rice
- `1 lb` chicken breast (optional)
- `1 tsp` garlic powder
- `0.5 tsp` oregano
- `1 tsp` onion powder

> Wash the potatoes and carrots, skin and cut accordingly. 
>
> In a bowl, sprinkle 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp garlic powder, 0.5 tsp oregano, and 1 tsp onion powder on the chicken breast. Mix well and let sit for 10 minutes.
> 
> Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a large wok. Cook the chicken on both sides for 8-10 minutes, or until fully cooked. Remove from the wok and set aside (cut into slices).
> 
> Stir fry the potatoes and carrots for 5-7 minutes. Sprinkle salt to coat the vegetables.
>

> Reflecting on this recipe, I japanese curry is so easy with box curry mixes. I plan to make this again with more vegetable combinations and increase the protein to get those gains!!!
