description: My twenty-first recipe! Falafel is a popular Middle Eastern dish that is made from ground chickpeas and greens. It is usually served in a pita, which acts as a pocket, dipped in a tahini sauce or hummus. The falafel balls are topped with salads, pickled vegetables, hot sauce, and drizzled with tahini-based sauces. Falafel balls may also be eaten alone as a snack.

rating: Rating 7/10, a very delicious and healthy meal! The falafel balls are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The texture is great, however, the inside is a bit bland. So, a sauce or hummus are necessary to eat alongside the falafel.
