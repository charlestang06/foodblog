description: My fourteenth recipe! Spanish Paella is a delicious seafood rice dish served with seafood, chicken, vegetables, and a very expensive and potent seasoning called Saffron. The rice dish is usually cooked in a large pan, and then served with lemon slices. Paella can be cooked in a multitude of ways, such as using rabbit meat, chorizo, pork, and other vegetarian options.

rating: Rating 8/10, I made it with my Spanish friend and the paella turned out really great and the rice was very tender and had the socarrat at the bottom. The flavor was seafood-ey but not too much, and the chicken was very tender. The lemon slices also balanced the flavor well. I should've added more saffron to balance the color or food dye. Furthermore, using fresh seafood probably would've made it better.
