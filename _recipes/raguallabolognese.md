description: My twentieth recipe! Ragu Alla Bolognese is a classic Italian beef meat sauce that is perfect for pasta, lasagna, or even on its own. It is a rich, hearty, and flavorful sauce that is perfect for a cozy night in. 
date: February 3, 2024
rating: Rating 7/10, the beef was extremely tender and was fall-apart delicious. The sauce was rich and flavorful, although I think some more seasoning would be nice next time to boost the overwhelming tomato-y flavor.
