description: My tenth recipe! Bacalhau (or Bacalao in Spanish), is salted fish, which is used in a variety of cooking from stews to fried fish and Croquetas. Just salting fish filets makes Bacalhau Fresco, which is cured and salted for 1-2 weeks. I then cooked rice with the salted fish which makes Arroz de Bacalhau. This is my first time working with fish as well!
date: July 25-August 19, 2023
rating: Rating 6/10, the salted fish made the dish very fishy and salty, which could have been toned down from soaking for a longer period of time. It was still pretty good overal, and I could've added more vegetables to balance out the taste.
