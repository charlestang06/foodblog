title: Domoda (Gambia)
category: Africa
description: Domoda, or Domodah, is a Gambian Peanut Stew that is popular in West African countries. It is a thick stew made with peanut butter, tomatoes, and onions, and is usually served with rice. This was my first time cooking an African dish, and also the first time making a stew using a Dutch oven. Rating 4/10, it was alright, but a too peanut buttery (I used to be allergic to nuts) and I didn't really like the spice combination.
