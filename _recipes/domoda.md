description: My second recipe! Domoda is a Gambian Peanut Stew made with peanut butter, tomatoes, and onions, and is usually served with rice. This was my first time cooking an African dish, and also the first time making a stew using a Dutch oven.
date: June 6, 2023
rating: Rating 4/10, it was alright, but a too peanut buttery (I used to be allergic to nuts) and I didn't really like the spice combination. The sweet potato doesn't go too well with the stew either.

>
> Add in tomato paste, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cloves, salt, and pepper (spice mix from prep). Cook for 2 minute, stirring constantly. Add in a splash or two of water to prevent sticking.

> Here are some more pictures throughout the process of cooking the stew. It was a mess at first since I put too much water (or too much sweet potatoes), so I had to scoop water out midway, the consistency turned out alright at the end, however. The simmering process did not boil out as much water as I had hoped to either.
