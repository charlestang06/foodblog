description: My eigth recipe! This is the first North American (and Latin American) dish I made so far. It was a very interesting dish to make, as it used many ingredients that I have never used before (such as pepitas and sesame seeds). The sauce smelled so delicious throughout the process, especially with the blend of toasted seeds. This is also the first time I used a food processor, which I dug up from the basement of my house.
date: July 16, 2023
rating: Rating 9/10, a pretty light and amazing dish, the spices were not too overwhelming and the pumpkin and sesame seeds add a lot of flavor. The chicken was also very tender and juicy, and the sauce was very rich and creamy. I would definitely make this again, but I would probably add more chicken and less broth to make the sauce thicker.

- ### Changes Made to Recipe

> Firstly, rather than boiling the chicken and making broth that way, I decided to cook the chicken in a pan to get a better texture and make a richer chicken broth using bouillon cubes. Definitely a better option because boiled chicken just doesn't taste good!
>
> Second, I could not find dried guajillo or pasilla peppers, but I did find guajillo powder and poblano peppers, which are very similar substitutes. It still came out very well, so it was an okay substitute.
>
> Lastly, I cut down on the chicken broth as I realized that the whole mixture was not going to fit in my small food processor (Which started leaking at one point). So, I cut down on the broth to make the sauce less watery and worked very well.
