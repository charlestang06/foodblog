            I'm Charles, a current senior at Mass Academy, and my cooking skills
            are pretty limited. In the past, I have made breakfast eggs or basic
            fried rice dishes, but nothing fancier than home-friendly foods. In
            fact, I recently participated in Mass Academy's cooking club run by
            Ms. Small and Dr. Crowthers, which I greatly enjoyed. My SISP
            project is to spend at least 100 hours to become more skillful at
            cooking and experienced with various cultures and flavors around the
            globe. From learning different cooking tools to playing around with
            different spice combinations, I will embark on a journey across the
            world while staying in the vicinity of my kitchen.

            Furthermore, I hope to gain food blogging and photography skills by
            creating a food blog/online cookbook website showcasing my work. I
            hope you enjoy exploring these recipes I cook! I will also be
            leaving my personal reviews on each recipe I cook, and since I have
            a very particular taste for foods, don't get too riled up by my
            ratings; I am just a high school student.
